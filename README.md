## Running locally

To run the webserver, first folk this repository 

        git clone https://github.com/nliao917/Games-Games-Games

Go into the `webserver/` directory and run

        python server.py

It should print something like:

        running on 0.0.0.0:8111
        * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8111/

The `0.0.0.0` listens to any IPv4 address on the machine.  The `8111` after the `:` is the port number.
So if this is running on your laptop, you can open you web browser to `http://localhost:8111`.
